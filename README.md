# About [__dog.io__]()

This work is inspired by the prompt for Hugging Face's Game Jam 2023! We developed [__dog.io__]() and submitted our work as part of the competition.

Direct from the [sources](#sources) below, here is the prompt:
- The requirements:
    > To participate, your game should be playable on the web (e.g., itch.io) or Windows. Additionally, you are required to incorporate at least one open-source AI tool into your game or workflow.
- And the theme:
    > The theme is EXPANDING. Interpret this however you want.

    > This was a dope, new project to work on! Not only is it our first official collaboration from scratch to release, but we've never used Flutter or Dart before. I also have minimal exposure to Hugging Face, but have a newfound admiration for it from a technical perspective. My only is regret is that we should have started when it was announced...but, that won't keep me from continuing to polish it. ;)
